# This directory will store experiments results

Each experiment should produce 3 files:

* `<start-date>_experiment.log` - logs from the script running the experiment.
* `<start-date>_fw_logger.log` - logs from rs-fw-logger tool.
* `<start-date>_realsense.log` - logs from roslaunch files used to start camera nodes.
